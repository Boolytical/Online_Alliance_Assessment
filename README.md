In this repository, three .R files can be found to perform a MGCFA on the data set.
* `Initial_data_analysis.R`       This file reads an SPSS file into R and converts it to long format and wide format csv files.
* `Main_data_analysis.R`          This file runs the correlation matrix and specified MGCFA analysis.
* `CFA.R`                         This file contains the functions for the correlation and MGCFA analyses.
